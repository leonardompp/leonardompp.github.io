## My Bio

My name is Leonardo Mouta. I am currently a Master's student at Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics System Development program, class of 2025. Although currently a roboticist, my background is in aerospace engineering (MS - ISAE-SUPAERO, France; BS - Aeronautics Institute of Technology, Brazil), specializing in autonomous systems and fluid dynamics. I also dabble in quantum computing (Minor Degree in Engineering Physics - Aeronautics Institute of Technology, Brazil) and cybersecurity.

### Fields of Interest

My main interest is autonomous systems, particularly focusing in:

* Path planning
* Guidance and navigation
* Control theory
* Object manipulation
* Collision detection and avoidance

Other interests include cybersecurity, military history and literature. I also happen to know a vast collection of dad jokes and useless trivia.

### Videos

* In this video, an autonomous quadcopter had to intercept the Roomba robot, which was controlled by a human operator. The drone then had to follow the Roomba around, followed by an automatic landing at the base point. Interception was achieved by modeling the quadrotor's behavior as an MDP:
