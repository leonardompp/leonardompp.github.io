## My Bio

My name is Leonardo Mouta. I am currently majoring in aerospace engineering as an exchange student at ISAE-SUPAERO (France), with specializations in autonomous systems and fluid dynamics. Former aerospace engineering student at Brazil's Aeronautics Institute of Technology (ITA). 

### Fields of Interest

My main interest is autonomous systems, particularly UAVs of all types. Concerning UAVs, I have dealt with:

* Path planning
* Guidance and navigation
* Control theory
* Object manipulation
* Collision avoidance
* Etc.

Other interests include military history, literature and bad jokes.

### Videos

* In this video, an autonomous quadcopter had to intercept the Roomba robot, which was controlled by a human operator. The drone then had to follow the Roomba around, followed by an automatic landing at the base point. Interception was achieved by modeling the quadrotor's behavior as an MDP:
